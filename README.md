# ScreenShader: Custom screen color effects for macOS

ScreenShader is a simple utility to apply a user-specified fragment shader (color effect) to the screen. This provides more control than the fixed set of effects provided by existing apps.

## Examples

## Usage

Click on the app icon in the dock will open the Settings window, where you can select a pre-defined effect and activate it by clicking the checkbox:

![select effect and activate](https://github.com/branpk/ScreenShader/raw/main/images/select_activate.png)

The effect should now be visible. You can toggle it without opening the Settings window first by left clicking on the paintbrush icon in the menu bar:
